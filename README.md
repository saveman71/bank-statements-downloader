# Bank statements downloader scripts

I had the idea to get all my statements after reading this tweet: https://twitter.com/hondanhon/status/1499083344193097731

This repo indexes scripts I use to do just that. For now, LCL and La Banque Postale are supported.

These scripts do NOT handle sessions, etc. You must connect on your browser and copy the cookie. They also don't keep track of what's downloaded and are as dumb as the bank's filters so don't expect much.
